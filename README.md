Lab: Generative AI for Data Science. Examples

For each scenery, we wil generate a random data to test the code

We will work on three separate real-world scenarios. 
Each scenario will have a task for you to complete, along with a discussion component highlighting differences in generated code based on the individual prompts used. 
The focus is on learning how different prompting strategies can lead to various generated solutions.

Recall the prompt engineering process:

Problem Definition & Scope
Context Setting & Framework
Initial Prompt Construction
Refinement & Testing
Iteration & Optimization
As well as the more general process for generating code:

Requirement Analysis & Planning
Development Strategy
Iterative Code Generation
Testing & Validation
Refinement & Optimization

Sceneries
1) Retail Inventories
2) Website Analytics Debug
3) Customer Segmentation Query
